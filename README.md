# Identity Verification Pipeline

This project is part of the **Bio Secure MVP**.

## 🎯 Purpose
A modular pipeline for verifying identity and detecting forged or AI-generated content.  
The system will be built in phases, each adding DevOps and security features.

## 🚀 Current Phase (1)
- [x] Repo structure setup
- [ ] Batch scanning engine (files → hashes + confidence scores)
- [ ] Audit logging to track scans

## 📂 Planned Phases
1. Core Basics (GitHub setup, CLI, scanning engine)
2. Infrastructure & Containers (Terraform, AWS S3, Docker)
3. Pipelines & Automation (CI/CD, Jenkins, EC2)
4. Security & Incident Response (Bash automation, monitoring, rollbacks)
5. Enterprise Scaling (Compliance, public vs enterprise mode toggle)

## ⚙️ Setup
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://<YOUR_TOKEN>@github.com/DasiaCodes/identity-verification-pipeline.git
cd identity-verification-pipeline
pip install -r requirements.txt
